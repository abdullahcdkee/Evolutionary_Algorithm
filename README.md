# Evolutionary_Algorithms
The repository contains the solutions to Assignment 1 of the Computational Intelligence course by Dr. Saleha Raza taught at Habib University.

## Part 1

Two different benchmark problems are solved using genetic algorithms. These are

* Travelling Salesman Problem
* Knapsack Problem

## Part 2 

Genetic algorithms were used in an attempt to simulate evolutionary art. The goal was to use polygons to recreate famous images like the Mona Lisa. The attempt was inspired from the famous [Roger Johannson post relating to genetic programming.](https://rogerjohansson.blog/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/)

##

In both parts, the following selection schemes were implemented and their effects on the fitness function were observed:

* Random Selection
* Binary Tournament Selection
* Fitness Proportional Selection
* Rank Based Selection 
* Truncation Selection

Mutation and Crossover logics were also adjusted, alongside parameters like population, generation, parent size, survivor size etc. in attempts to achieve optimal fitness values.

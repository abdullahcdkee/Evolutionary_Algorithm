# Evolutionary_Algorithm
The repository contains the solutions to Assignment 1 of the Computational Intelligence course by Dr. Saleha Raza taught at Habib University.

The assignment is in two parts. Part 1 deals with coding the solution to the travelling salesman problem and the knapsack problem using evolutionary algorithms. Part 2 deals with evolutionary art and attempts to use polygons to recreate famous images like the Mona Lisa.
